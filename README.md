# Overview
The long-term goal is managing with ease the unified_config system all by myself, and having a fresh knowledge of servercore topics.
Then, the focus will move to modern programming architecture and best-practices, like DDD, microservices, which I've already covered in the past.

# Logs
## 17/12/2021
- Terminated C++ course: I'll start using c++ as the main language for extra-related work, so as to strengthen the knowledge.
- Terminated CMake Tutorial: good hands-on tutorial
- Looking at the conan repo tool in order to use with cmake: with this tool c++ starts looking a modern lang :) (although with its limits, like lack of interfaces..)

# Topics
## Programming Languages
### C++
[Link to the Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/learn/lecture/27255982#overview)

A massive online course that makes you discover the main functionalities of C++20.
It's quite boring (he reads slides all the time and he makes boring examples by repeating himself way too much. I'd have appreciated references to learn yourself once the basic concept has been explained. Meh.) 
and it's better used as a guideline for the main topics you should cover in order to know the basics of C++.
Just used this because I paid for it, at least I've paid it for something.

### Cmake
[Youtube video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlKcXPUJGwA&list=PLalVdRk2RC6o5GHu618ARWh0VO0bFlif4)

Well done, it makes you discover from scratch how cmake works, without leaving any "magic" functionality

### Conan
[Manual](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/introduction.html)

Jus reading the manual so as to use the repo for the projects

## Fundamentals
### Operating systems
[Like to the udacity course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud923)

A hands-on massive online course to go over the main concepts of Operating Systems.
* Threads
* Concurrency (the part I care most)

### Algorithms and Data Structure
[Link to the lecutre's videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr_f7uNI48xCmsG4zVuhU-g/playlists)

It's among the 3 best universities in Italy, the course is in italian, being recorder in remote during the pandemic lockdown. 
If you attended an algorithm and data structure's course at the university, this course does not give you new knowledge.
It's just a "go over your knowledge" on specific concepts I think they're useful in our developer daily life like: 
- Graph algorithms
- Flow algorithms
- Dynamic programming

# Log
## 20/08/2021
- Started reading Domain-Driven Design Distilled

## 2/07/2021
- Completed the course "Comunicación entre microservicios: Event-Driven Architecture"
- Trying out architectural setup with the api gateway krakend and auth via auth0 on the pet project. Next, I'll setup jäger and ELK stack for logging, monitoring and tracing

## 11/06/2021
- Completed the course "CQRS"
- Completed the kata repository of applied DDD, CQRS and some event-driven architecture for microservices in node.js. Available at: https://github.com/brtbrt/ddd-in-JS-sample
- Started course "Comunicación entre microservicios: Event-Driven Architecture"

## 30/04/2021
Retaken some architecture principles.
- Completed the course "DDD Aplicado". It gives a down-to-earth, keep-it-real cases where DDD is applied, and how. It's useful to complete the DDD knowledge pragmatically, and in order to apply on projects / adopt in teams step by step, without disrupting useless changes.
- ...but is DDD applicable on Front? After a long research, by random chatting with my network of people I've bumped into a frontend architect who is redesigning a new frontend in DDD. He explained me his point of view and passed me the talk he gave, which is linked above "Framework-independend, decoupled frontend architecture for large-scale projects". Actually it opened me a new world, since I though I was the only one who had the impression that a domain is well needed for big frontend apps, which we don't do here, actually.

On pure frontend side I've read a handful of articles and seen a lot of videos: "Learning FP with Javascript" it's perfect as a primer, recommended because it helps to choose the right resources to learn it thoroughly next, by getting the grasp.A

I've also went over some basic concepts I had rusted: XSS and CSRF explained video are perfect. Recommended too.

This took way much more than the 3 hours allowed: I simply see these 3 hours as an extension of time I dedicate to my interests, and that they do match with Novum's ones.
