# Topics
The following are the topics I've planned to cover during my hours dedicated to studying. Additional non-planned material could be added in the future on the logs, and hence here, if casually bumping into them and worth a reading/studying/watching.

# Log
## 11/06/2021
- Completed the course "CQRS"
- Completed the kata repository of applied DDD, CQRS and some event-driven architecture for microservices in node.js. Available at: https://github.com/brtbrt/ddd-in-JS-sample
- Started course "Comunicaci칩n entre microservicios: Event-Driven Architecture"

## 30/04/2021
Retaken some architecture principles.
- Completed the course "DDD Aplicado". It gives a down-to-earth, keep-it-real cases where DDD is applied, and how. It's useful to complete the DDD knowledge pragmatically, and in order to apply on projects / adopt in teams step by step, without disrupting useless changes.
- ...but is DDD applicable on Front? After a long research, by random chatting with my network of people I've bumped into a frontend architect who is redesigning a new frontend in DDD. He explained me his point of view and passed me the talk he gave, which is linked above "Framework-independend, decoupled frontend architecture for large-scale projects". Actually it opened me a new world, since I though I was the only one who had the impression that a domain is well needed for big frontend apps, which we don't do here, actually.

On pure frontend side I've read a handful of articles and seen a lot of videos: "Learning FP with Javascript" it's perfect as a primer, recommended because it helps to choose the right resources to learn it thoroughly next, by getting the grasp.A

I've also went over some basic concepts I had rusted: XSS and CSRF explained video are perfect. Recommended too.

This took way much more than the 3 hours allowed: I simply see these 3 hours as an extension of time I dedicate to my interests, and that they do match with Novum's ones.
